Welcome to the repo for the DataSearch Website created as part of the Final Year Project, 2020.

The website code is structured in three directories:
    data: All the data used in this website,
    static: All code (js, py) used,
    templates: All HTML and CSS files used,
    reportData: data used in the report.

Main libraries used:
DataMaps for World Maps,
Charts.js for all Charts,

All code was created by me, Damien Pilat (2020) unless otherwise specified.
